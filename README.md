# ShipmentManagement

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.10.

## Details
The application loads shipments on the main page.

Shipment's status can be edited and new shipment can be registered. Multiple deletion of shipments is available.

Mock data is passed through interceptor, with success and error responses returned, so api can be simulated.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Testing

Tests have been applied to most components and functions.
